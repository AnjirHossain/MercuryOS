#### Mercury OS Implementation

Repository housing my contributions to [Artefactgroup](https://www.artefactgroup.com/) R&D Summit 2019 submissions. The project is an implementation of [Mercury OS](https://uxdesign.cc/introducing-mercury-os-f4de45a04289) HCI Paradigm. The focus of this project revolves around aggregating emails from [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) and [Icloud Kit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/) in order to display them in a manner outlined in the Mercury OS article. Other components in this project include, but aren't limited to [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Sentiment Analysis for [Squeaky Wheel Detection](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/detecting-squeaky-wheel-urgency-in-customer-support-tickets/?ref=Welcome.AI) to drive the ordering of aggregated emails from all platforms.
